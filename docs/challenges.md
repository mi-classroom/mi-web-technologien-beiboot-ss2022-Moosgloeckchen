# Biggest challenges encountered along the way

## Three dimensional realm
As it was completely new to me working with a three dimensional realm, I had a hard time creating and working in one. My approach was to start a new project and create a 3D area without any Chranach context. That started out okay, with me getting to know three.js when I transferred the knowledge onto the Cranach project, the specifications became hard to implement. Especially the implementation of a camera and the controller gave me a hard time.

## Painting sizes
Also the sizing of the paintings caused difficulties. I was not able to ditermine the dimensions by the textfield dimensions. So I decided to use *sizes.medium.dimensions.height* and *sizes.medium.dimensions.width* for the aspect ratio within an image and the *maxDimensions* for the overall sizing of the image in order to have a comparison between all paintings
The sizing might not be 100% correct.
