# Add-on: Ally

* Status: accepted
* Workload: 1 <!-- optional -->
* Decider: [Linn√©a Doberstein](https://github.com/Moosgloeckchen)
* Issue: [25](https://github.com/mi-classroom/mi-web-technologien-beiboot-ss2022-Moosgloeckchen/issues/25) <!-- optional -->
* Date: 2022-09-10 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

This projects goal is to make the references between individual works and groups of works tangible. The last issue focusses on optimizing/expanding the project in such a way, that it is even more aligned with the objective. 

## Considered Options

* Overview: Move camera into a position that a general overview becomes visible
* Alternative control
* (alternative) visualization of the links
* Audio, e.g. reading aloud the description text
* Incorporate accessibility

## Decision Outcome

As the last Issue was left wide open, the developers were free to get inspired by their individual fields of interest. So I decided to connect this project with the Workshop held in this Seminar. As three dimensional websites often are not barrier free, the decision was set to "Incorporate accessibility". Besides that, arguments for the decision do not differ from those for deciding to create a Workshop on the topic - to raise awareness on Web Accessibility and create more useable sites for people with limitations.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* expand the experience to people with limitations
* React Three Ally can be used

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
